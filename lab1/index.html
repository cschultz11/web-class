			<h1>An Analysis of Consumer Price Index (CPI) of Urban Environments</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The Consumer Price Index, abbreviated as CPI, reflects the average cost index of goods in an environment.
		CPI varies from nation to nation, and likewise, from city to city. There are several variables that impact the CPI, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Monetary Exchange Rates</li>
			<li>Inflation</li>
			<li>Population Density</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The third item, population density, is the most important regarding this analysis, as it reflects how the average population in
		a city can impact the base cost of goods and services. There are three main sets of goods and services that are directly impacted
		by population density when it comes to the consumer price index reflecting on the urban goods basket:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Government Expenses (Taxes, Utilities, etc.)</li>
			<li>Groceries</li>
			<li>Public Transportation</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The most notable in this study is the public transportation cost, as it is an important tool utilized by almost every individual
		who resides in an urban environment. Using the information provided by the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and further compacting that data into
		a more manageable amount, there is a clear correlation between the CPI of public transportation and the base CPI, with the public transportation costs
		fluctuating far more inconsistently due to ridership numbers each month. As such, the average urban CPI of a base goods basket will be less than the average
		public transportation CPI for that same time period.
